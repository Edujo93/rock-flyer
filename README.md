### Before starting:

**The goal** is for you to replicate the flyer styles that you will find in the `original-flyer.jpg` file.

In this repository you will find **almost everything** you need to solve the task.

In the `/styles` folder you will find the `normalize.css` file that is already linked in the `index.html`. 

> üí°  This file  makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. <br>
In other words, it overwrites or modifies some style properties that the user-agent (browser) injects in every html and we usually don't want. For example: an 8px margin in the body element or some default margins in the headings or paragraph elements. 

In this same folder is the `styles.css` file. This is the file where you will add all the styles you want. 

In the `/assets` folder you have the flyer background. You can also use this folder to save any other image or icon files.

### Minimum requirements:

- The fonts must be as similar as possible to the original file. 

    - Remember that you can download free fonts from [1001freefonts](https://www.1001freefonts.com/) and add the necessary files to the project.

    - You can also work with [Google fonts]( https://fonts.google.com/) and link the fonts to the project by inserting the script that the site gives you, as we saw in the last session.

- The spaces and distances between words should be as precise as possible. Please avoid using the `<br>` tag as much as possible.

    - To achieve this you can work with the **margin and padding** properties.
    - Start with these [Box model docs](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)
    - Then read the following [Margin docs](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp)
    - And finally take a look at these [Padding docs](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp)

- All the text elements must be added only inside the `<div>` with the class "flyer"
<br>

>üîç Hint: [text-align](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.php) is a property that you may also find usefull to align some words.

### Steps:

1. **Fork** this repository. This action makes a copy in your GitHub account. 
2. **Clone** the forked repository from your own GitHub account. 
3. Open the folder in VSC
4. Link the `styles.css` file to the `index.html` file.
5. Complete the path to the `flyer.png` file inside the `url()` value of the `background-image` property.   
6. Add all the HTML text elements you in order.
7. You can replace the original band names with the bands you want üòâ.
7. You can organize the text content in `<section>`, `<article>` or `<div>`elements as you need.
8. Don¬¥t forget to read the **documentation** you will find at the bottom of these instructions ü§ì.

### üèÜ Gives extra points:

- Include all the icons you see in the flyer. You can use `svg` or `png` files. 
- How about you investigate how to place the letters inside the first banner following its curved shape?
